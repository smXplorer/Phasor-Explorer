Phasor Explorer was developed to accompany an article discussing the properties of the phasor of continutous or discrete binned or time-gated periodic decays:

X. Michalet, "Continuous and discrete phasor analysis of binned or time-gated periodic decays"

AIP Advances *11*, 035331 (2021); https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0027834

Overview of the User Interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The user interface consists in a main window with a top menu bar (File, Windows, Edit, Analysis).

The user interface elements (graphs, buttons, numeric controls and indicators, etc.) displayed on the window can be modified with the help of a pull-down menu below the menu bar, offering the following options:

- Phasor Plot
- Pseudo Phasor Lifetime
- Decay, Gate & Gated Decay

In addition to the main window, the Windows menu gives access to 4 other windows

- Notebook
- Settings
- Context Help
- About

These different UI elements and their functions are described in separate sections of the manual.
